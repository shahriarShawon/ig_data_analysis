# Project Overview
In this project, I've analyzed a social media dataset to gain insights into user behavior and engagement. I've used various SQL techniques such as SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, HAVING, DAYNAME, Subqueries, Aliasing, LIMIT, and ORDER BY to answer a set of predetermined questions/tasks.

# Dataset Description
The dataset consists of seven tables:

1. comments
2. follows
3. likes
4. photo_tags
5. photos
6. tags
7. users

# Answered the following questions
**Task 1: Find the 5 oldest users**

This task involves identifying the five oldest users based on their registration date.

**Task 2: Identify the two most popular days of the week for user registrations**

This task aims to determine the two days of the week with the highest number of user registrations.

**Task 3: Determine the number of inactive users**

This task, added as a personal challenge, involves finding the count of users who have never posted a photo.

**Task 4: Identify inactive users**

Building on Task 3, this task requires identifying the inactive users who have never posted a photo.

**Task 5: Identify the most liked photo and its user**

This task involves identifying the most liked photo and the user who posted it.

**Task 6: Calculate the average number of photos per user**

This task calculates the average number of photos posted per user.

**Task 7: Find the 5 most popular hashtags**

This task identifies the five most popular hashtags used in the dataset.

**Task 8: Identify bots who have liked all photos**

This task involves identifying users who have liked every photo in the dataset, potentially indicating bot behavior.

# Techniques Used
The tasks were accomplished using various basic SQL techniques including:

- SELECT statements
- JOIN operations
- GROUP BY clause
- HAVING clause
- DAYNAME function
- Simple Subqueries
- Aliasing
